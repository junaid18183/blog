## About Me

I like to describe myself as a system engineer with a strong background in infrastructure and operations. 

With over 15+ years of experience in system admin,system automation,devops,team building & interpersonal skills ; I love to work with servers to build and maintain critical production infrastructure and applications.

Nowadays, I spend most of my time building the technologies of today and tomorrow. I have had the chance to work in companies of different sizes,in a variety of industries, and to approach a multitude of problems in so many different ways.

I love sharing the knowledge I have and help people understand the technologies I am fond of, as much as I love hearing
other people telling about their experiences in the tech industry. You can sometimes find me on [Twitter][twitter]
helping people answering questions I've had to ask myself at some point as well.

## The blog

This blog is nothing but a place to hold and save the articles / knowledge of the things I think of and do, as a part of my profession.

I'm interested in everything related in one way or another to distributed system, serverless, infrastructure-as-code, continuous delivery and virtualization, cloud, kubernetes linux administration. 
Nowadays these subjects are so in vogue that the list of technologies I wish I could experiment with is almost endless.

The opinions expressed in the content I publish are my own. This blog is entirely [open-source][oss] and powered by
[Jekyll][jekyll]. 

If you like a post and feel like sharing it you can, but are not obliged to, mention my Twitter
username *@junaid18183*.
