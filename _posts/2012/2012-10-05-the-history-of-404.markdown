<div class="MsoNormal"><span>Before the beginning of time, when the Internet was<br />still very much under the spell of bare Unix shells<br />and Gopher, before SLIP or PPP became widely used, an <br />ambitious group of young scientists at CERN <br />(Switzerland) started working on what was to become<br />the media revolution of the nineties: the World Wide<br />Web, later to be known as WWW, or simply 'the Web'. <br />Their aim: to create a database infrastructure that <br />offered open access to data in various formats:<br />multi-media. The ultimate goal was clearly to create a<br />protocol that would combine text and pictures and<br />present it as one document, and allow linking to other <br />such documents: hypertext.</p>
<p>Because these bright young minds were reluctant to<br />reveal their progress (and setbacks) to the world,<br />they started developing their protocol in a <br />closed environment: CERN's internal network. Many <br />hours were spend on what later became the world-wide<br />standard for multimedia documents. Using the physical<br />lay-out of CERN's network and buildings as a metaphor <br />for the 'real world' they situated different functions <br />of the protocol in different offices within CERN.</p>
<p>In an office on the fourth floor (room 404), they<br />placed the World Wide Web's central database: any <br />request for a file was routed to that office, where <br />two or three people would manually locate the<br />requested files and transfer them, over the network,<br />to the person who made that request.</p>
<p>When the database started to grow, and the people at <br />CERN realized that they were able to retrieve <br />documents other than their own research-papers, not<br />only the number of requests grew, but also the number<br />of requests that could not be fulfilled, usually<br />because the person who requested a file typed in the <br />wrong name for that file. Soon these faulty requests<br />were answered with a standard message: "Room 404: file<br />not found".</p>
<p>Later, when these processes were automated and people<br />could directly query the database, the messageID's for <br />error messages remained linked to the physical<br />location the process took place: "404: file not<br />found".</p>
<p>The room numbers remained in the error codes in the<br />official release of HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer <br />Protocol) when the Web left CERN to conquer the world,<br />and are still displayed when a browser makes a faulty<br />request to a Web server. In memory of the heroic boys<br />and girls that worked deep into the night for all <br />those months, in those small and hot offices at CERN,<br />Room 404 is preserved as a 'place on the Web'. None of<br />the other rooms are still used for the Web. Room 404<br />is the only and true monument to the beginning of the <br />Web, a tribute to a place in the past, where the<br />future<br />was shaped.</span></div>
