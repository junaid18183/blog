<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">
<div>The Fedora Project has corporate sponsorship from Redhat Inc.Â  but  officially and properly speaking the Fedora distribution itself (by the  way, it's not <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD1">Fedora Core<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> anymore) is not a product of Redhat Inc.</p>
<p>The biggest <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD6">differences<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> are:<br />1) Community support (Fedora) <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD4">versus<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> paid support (Redhat)<br />2) Release cycle: Fedora releases every 6 months and a given version is (supposedly) only <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD2">supported<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> for about 13 months, Redhat is supported for years<br />3)  Software stability: Fedora is a sort of testbed for bleeding-edge  software (but can be made to work in production environments if you're <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD5">dedicated<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span>); Redhat is specifically geared to production environments and contains tried-and-true software and feature implementations<br />4) Money</div>
