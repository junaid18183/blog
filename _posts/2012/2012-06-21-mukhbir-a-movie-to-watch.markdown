<div> Hi Guys, <br />This is straight from the horses mouth. Being a big time movie <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD4">Buff<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span>, you all can be rest assured that this one flick will note bore you and you'll get <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD7">to know<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> many new things happening around.'Mukhbir' is a story of a protagonist who is forced by the situations into <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD8">the business<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> of espionage. Mani Shankar's storytelling is highly original.</p>
<p>What  'Mukhbir' does to the spy genre is to turn it inside out. We aren't  looking at James Bond's stirred-and-sexy world of the spy who loved the  good life.<span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD3">The sequence<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> where the 'Mukhbir' must watch his mentor being tortured and then kill  him with his own hands without giving the game away is devastating in  its intensity and impact.The <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD1">final<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD2">dialogue<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> on Islam and violence between Rahul Dev lingers after the film.</p>
<p>This  is very close to real and force one to think that there are many unsung  heroes in our society who are doing their jobs with their life on the  edge.</p></div>
