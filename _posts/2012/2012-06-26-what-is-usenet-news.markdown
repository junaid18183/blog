<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Usenet News is a global electronic <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD4">bulletin<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD5">board<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> system in which millions of computer users exchange information on a vast range of topics. The major difference between Usenet News and e-mail discussion groups is the fact that Usenet  messages are stored on central computers, and users must connect to  these computers to read or download the messages posted to these groups.  This is distinct from e-mail distribution, in which messages arrive in  the electronic <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD2">mailboxes<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> of each list member. Usenet itself is a set of machines that exchanges messages, or articles, from Usenet discussion forums, called <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD1">newsgroups<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span></div>
