<li>A Support Ticket Software is a smart solution to support email queries quickly and efficiently without duplication of effort.</li>
<li>The advanced system of email <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD3">ticketing<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> helps a better communication among customers and system users.</li>
<li>Having  such a tool is designed to first of all organize all of your support  workload and secondly to reduce the amount of time you spend answering  customers, (This is a big advantage because if your customers aren’t  asking questions it means they are getting all their issues resolved so  they don’t have to go through that hassle.) </li>
<li>This is an efficient package that incorporates a full email history, group access and multiple user log in, inventory <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD11">tracking<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span>, customized ticket browsing facility, list manipulation, follow up and monitoring the ticket status and many other <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD5">facilities<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> that truly support service management competently. </li>
<li>It helps <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD4">the customer service<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> team to locate <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD12">the status<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> of their queries each time, immediately whenever they want. It is a logical and organized <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD8">approach<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> towards problem management and <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD10">troubleshooting<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span>. By raising trouble <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD2">tickets<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> that are accepted, and sent for resolving to the relevant system  operators, the software actually assigns a system operator with the  particular task of handling the problem ticket that is uniquely assigned  to the same person. This also ensures that while answering the same no  one else in the groups has the same ticket simultaneously. </li>
<li>You  can install this system on your server easily and effectively. Depending  on which one you use it will have comprehensive user interface and  automatic tagging facility with unique ticket IDs. </li>
<li>Instant <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD9">Response System<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> or IRS helps in real-time conversation among the seekers and providers.  With all the advanced features you can get, responding to customer  issues becomes convenient and speedy and you can use the knowledgebase  to reply to the inquiries put forward through tickets. </li>
<li>Ticket Views assists to set filters the incoming ticket lists. Customizing, Sorting, and using additional filters to organize the ticket for better status review makes the support ticket  software indisputable. Login sharing feature makes it easy for clients  and users to log in simultaneously without remembering passwords and  this can be controlled from a single database. </li>
<li>Reporting based  on advanced filters employed enables generation of reports sorted by  department, date, time, user, or client. The system also makes easy to  track <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD6">the Service<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> Level agreement (SLA) status i.e. whether met timely or not. Additionally, workload analysis and task <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD7">summary<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> enhances the service management features, by tracking the task/ activity of system operators within a given period in a support ticket software. </li>
<li>Purchased Software and Freeware </li>
<li>Some  of these programs available could be open source and you need no pay  anything to use those. Only problem with freeware is sometimes these are  crippled versions of what they can exactly do. The basic features are  more or less common in a freeware and purchased support ticket software. The purchased products gain an edge because of the value-added features that allow greater flexibility and options. </li>
