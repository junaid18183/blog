<p><span>I just finished </span><span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD5">the book<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span><span> "Outliers: The Story of Success" by Malcolm Gladwell</span></p>
<p><span>the key </span><span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD4">concepts of<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span><span> the book are that yes, it takes a lot of </span><span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD6">hard work<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span><span> to be successful, but that thereâ€™s some luck involved in getting to be  in a place where that work counts for something, or is even possible.</span></p>
<p><span>I like the way Malcolm Gladwell presented the book, specially the case study sort of </span><span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD3">examples<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span><span> gives you A New Way of Thinking About Success.</span></div>
