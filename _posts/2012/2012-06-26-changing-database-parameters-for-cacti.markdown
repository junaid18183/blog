<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Folks, I have installed the Cacti successfully on my server working  great. The only thing is I have shifted my database to other server and  thats why I am not able to access cacti's web interface anymore.</p>
<p>I want to change the IP of database for cacti configuration but did not find anything.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>the <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD5">configuration file<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> for Cacti is present at the location </p>
<p>cacti/include/config.php </p>
<p>change the database <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD1">hostname<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> of in this file and you are done</div>
