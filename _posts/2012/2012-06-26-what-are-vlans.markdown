<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">What are VLANs ?</p>
<p>VLANs are broadcast domains in a Layer 2 network. Each <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD1">broadcast domain<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> is like a distinct virutal bridge within the switch. Each virtual bridge you create in a switch defines a broadcast domain. By default, traffic from one VLAN cannot <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD3">pass<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> to another VLAN. Each of the users in a VLAN would also be in the same IP Subnet. Each switch port can <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD5">belong<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> to only one VLAN.</div>
