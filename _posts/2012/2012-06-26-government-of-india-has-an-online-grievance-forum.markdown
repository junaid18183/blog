<p>Many of us say that these things don't work in India . <br />Couple  of months back, the Faridabad Municipal Corporation laid new roads in  his area and the residents were very happy about it. But 2 weeks later,  BSNL dug up the newly laid roads to install new cables which annoyed all  the residents.. A resident used the above listed grievance forum to  highlight his concern.. To his surprise, BSNL and Municipal Corporation  of Faridabad were served a show cause notice and the guy received a copy  of the notice in one week. Government has asked the MC and BSNL about  the goof up as it's clear that both the government departments were not  in sync at all. </p>
<p>So use this grievance forum and educate others who don't know about this facility. <br />This way we can at least raise our concerns instead of just talking about the 'System' in India . </p>
<p>Invite your friends to contribute for many such happenings.</p>
