<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">What is Tunneling ?</p>
<p>Tunneling is the most <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD3">significant<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> component of VPN technology.  Tunneling is the technique of encapsulating an entire <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD4">data packet<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> in the packet of another <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD2">protocol<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> format. When a tunneled packet is routed to the destination node, it travels across the <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD1">internet work<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> through a logical path. This logical path is referred to as a tunnel.   Tunneling is analogous to sending a letter. After you write a letter,  you place it in an envelope. This envelope displays <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD5">the address of<span class="IL_AD_ICON"></span></span> the recipient. When you post this letter, it is delivered to the  recipient according to the address on the envelope. The recipient then  needs to open the envelope to read the letter.</div>
