    alt=\"\"><em>About the image - I originally thought naming this post \"How to
    Hire Ninjas\" but then realised I don't honestly like the analogy. DevOps people
    are not ninjas - they don't work in disguise and aren't trained from the very
    childhood. Moreover - this heroical ninja image is actually harmful. It only contributes
    to the DevOps identity crisis as outlined by Baron Schwartz and lies at the very
    heart of the problem that I'm trying to suggest a solution for here.</em>\r\n\r\nIt's
    no secret that the tech workforce market is starving for DevOps. (I know, I know
    - DevOps is not a job title, it's a mindset.) The cloud, BigData and modern software
    delivery standards all produce the need for professionals who know how to get
    those complicated systems built, deployed and running. The demand keeps growing
    and the supply just doesn't seem to catch up. More and more organisations realise
    they need to bring \"DevOps guys\" on board.\r\n\r\nNow how do you do this? Not
    an easy question! Especially considering the discipline and accompanying tools
    are all new and the term 'DevOps' is very loosely defined. As Tim Lockwood correctly
    notices : \"the pool of candidates who have had the opportunity to master [the
    devops tools and techniques] is small\" Even if you already have \"ninjas\" on
    your team - the chances are they aren't particularly good at hiring others like
    them. Now, I'm being gentle here - most of them are disastrous at hiring as they
    expect the candidates to have mastered the exact same set of tools as and gained
    same experiences as themselves. Taking in account the number of currently available
    tools, technologies and solutions it's very hard (not to say impossible) to find
    that exact match. Moreover, as many have already noticed - in fact the soft skills
    are the most important part of the DevOps toolkit and they can easily get overlooked
    if you concentrate on knowledge and technical ability only. The potential candidate
    may be a Linux system guru but have no understanding whatsoever of development
    need for flexibility and fast change rate. Or be a Python virtuoso but posess
    zero service-orientation.\r\n\r\nThe high demand for DevOps professionals makes
    things even harder with top candidates requiring top salaries and thus elevating
    the cost of mistake in case of a bad hire.\r\n\r\nA great approach is the one
    suggested by Jez Humble - don't hire DevOps experts, but instead grow them. As
    someone who has hired and trained a number of talented novices - I can confirm
    this is a valid and sustainable solution, especially if the organization provides
    the necessary means for retaining and developing that talent.\r\n\r\nStill - hiring
    novices presents another risk - how do you know someone would be good at what
    they do if they haven't done that in the past?\r\n\r\nHow do you identify that
    great DevOps enabler? Well, as Uri Cohen lined out in his great talk on the subject
    - we should first of all be looking for:\r\n\r\nPassion and willingness to learn\r\nProblem
    solving mentality\r\nSelf-motivation\r\nGreat social skills\r\nTools and experience
    are important, but are not the only, and certainly not the most important factor.\r\n\r\nThat's
    all great, but what questions do you ask at the interview? How exactly do you
    identify these traits?\r\n\r\nHere's what I do, and what worked for me in the
    past:\r\n\r\nLook for passion about people and not just technology (after all
    the main purpose of DevOps is helping people work better)\r\nLook for system-wide
    vision ( ask to explain how their work influenced their previous organization's
    ability to deliver software )\r\nDon't probe for knowledge, but rather for understanding
    and ability to learn new stuff and solve new problems.\r\nNow I also have a method
    for verifying that last point. I think this works much better then giving the
    candidate a bash scripting test, asking to write pseudo-code on the white board
    or throwing her tricky questions about linux command options. I call it the \"hello
    new world\" method. It goes something like this:\r\n\r\nFind a tool/technology
    your candidate hasn't worked with in the past.\r\nGive them a computer connected
    to the internet.\r\nAsk to perform a very basic task with that tool/technology.
    Something that can be completed in an hour. (A 'hello world' type task)\r\nTell
    them it's ok to not complete the task in full - that their way of thinking is
    what interests you most. (this is to release some of the pressure that comes from
    being under test)\r\nAfter the hour has passed (or after the candidate completed
    the task) - review the results together asking to explain what they did and why
    they did it.\r\nI like this approach as it allows me to test a few connected things:\r\n\r\nwillingness
    to learn : your ideal candidate will be happy to do this as good DevOps always
    jump at opportunities to learn new stuff\r\nability to solve new problems ( in
    a defined time scope)\r\ncommunication skills - i.e the ability to explain and
    justify their solution\r\nI've used this to hire all my past team members (and
    when assisting some of my clients with their DevOps hiring process) and they all
    proved to be great guys to work with. And some of them turned out to be real ninjas
    in the end ;)\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you decide to try the \"hello new world\"
    approach and if it works for you as well. Or if you have other tricks that you
    feel do the work.\r\n\r\nJust remember - DevOps is not about tools, it's about
    people.\r\n\r\n<em>originally published on my linkedIn:Â <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-hire-devops-anton-weiss?trk=mp-author-card\">How
